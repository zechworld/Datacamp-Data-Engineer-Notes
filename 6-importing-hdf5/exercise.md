# Exercise 1

The file 'LIGO_data.hdf5' is already in your working directory. In this exercise, you'll import it using the h5py library. You'll also print out its datatype to confirm you have imported it correctly. You'll then study the structure of the file in order to see precisely what HDF groups it contains.

```python
import numpy as np
import h5py

# Assign filename: file
file = 'LIGO_data.hdf5'

# Load file: data
data = h5py.File(file, 'r')

# Print the datatype of the loaded file
print(type(data))

# Print the keys of the file
for key in data.keys():
	print(key)
```





# Exercise 2
In this exercise, you'll extract some of the LIGO experiment's actual data from the HDF5 file and you'll visualize it.

To do so, you'll need to first explore the HDF5 group 'strain'.

```python
# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import h5py

# File
file = 'LIGO_data.hdf5'

# Load file
data = h5py.File(file, 'r')

# Get the HDF5 group: group
group = data['strain']

# Check out keys of group
for key in group.keys():
	print(key)
	# Strain

# Set variable equal to time series data: strain
strain = np.array(data['strain']['Strain'])

# Set number of time points to sample: num_samples
num_samples = 10000

# Set time vector
time = np.arange(0, 1, 1/num_samples)

# Plot data
plt.plot(time, strain[:num_samples])
plt.xlabel('GPS Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('strain')
plt.show()
```

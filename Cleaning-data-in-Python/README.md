# Data type constrains

Lets us remember the Data Science Workflow

1. Acces Data
2. Explore and process data
3. Extract insights
4. Report insights

If data is not cleaned, presenting duplicates, mis-pellings, data type parsing errors, legacy systems or whatever other error we will compromise the insights and integrity of reports.

Before preparing any analysis, we should make sure our variables have the correct data type. We make sure of this using some attributes and methods from Pandas package.

# Import Data

We can import data from multiple sources like:

- Flat files: .txt .csvs
- Navite files: Excel Spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, MATLAB files
- Relational Database: SQLite PostgreSQL

## Flat files
This files can be classified into two types of files that differ
in how they organize the data they carry:

	1. Plain Text: This category holds items like a novel, book, or a simple
	text file.

	2. Records: This category holds items like a table that could be inside a
	csv file, rows could be passengers and columns a feature (gender, cabin, etc)

# Package = collection of modules

# Packages are free

# Download = Terminal -> python3 -m pip install <package name>

# Import = import <package name>
import pandas

# Aliasing
import pandas as pd

# Aliasing allows to shorten the usage of the package name
# To call a function within the package we would use the alias instead of the full name

# Functions = code to perform a task
# Method = a function that is specific to a data type

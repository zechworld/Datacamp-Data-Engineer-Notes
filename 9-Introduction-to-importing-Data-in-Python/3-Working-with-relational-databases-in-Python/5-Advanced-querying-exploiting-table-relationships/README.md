# Advanced querying: Exploiting table relationships

So far we've been using basic queries using `WHERE` or `ORDER BY`. But we can go further into making advanced queries if we pay attention to the posibilities available for us using a Relational Database. If we look closely, the database we've been using so far has three tables: `Orders`, `Employees`, and `Customers`.

Each of these tables have a specific attribute that binds one table with another, using the `primary keys` and the `foreign keys`. The `Orders` table has an attribute `CustomerId` and an attribute `EmployeeId`, this in other words meands that these three tables are related to each other. We can access the attributes from one table in `SQL` using a simple concept: the `JOIN` clause.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Northwind")

df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT OrderID, CompanyName FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers on Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID", engine)

print(df.head())
```
